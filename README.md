# languageserver-vue

Adds the Vue Language Server to Atom.

Note: Atom support is just a proof of concept.

Atom's Language Client is incomplete and buggy.

Requirement
-------

It requires https://github.com/hedefalk/atom-vue installed.

Nuclide, https://atom.io/packages/nuclide, is optional but nice-to-have plugin.
